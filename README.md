# Warriors Name Generator

A Clan cats' name generator based on Erin Hunter's *[Warriors]* book series.

It will randomly generate a name in the format of `Prefixsuffix`, where all
prefixes and suffixes comes from cats of the official *Warriors* universe. Data
is collected from [Crystal Pool] (a structured knowledge-base) and will be
updated periodically.
